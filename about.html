                    seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit
                    Entertainment.[4] The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and
                    co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to
                    include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch
                    on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving
                    oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts
                    and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group has released several albums and performed
                    on several world tours.
