                BT21 was inspired by a comment from Suga, who thought the characters should represent both BTS and the
                21st century, so they would live for the next 100 years.</p>

                    Jin was drawing cute alpaca doodles for years before this collaboration, so he was excited to
                    finally bring one to life. The other members also say he looks like an alpaca, especially when he
                    eats.

                    bend and stretch into weird lengths and shapes. He’s a character that V has been drawing for some
                    time, and he wanted the character to be more unique than cute, as he personally loves unique
                    characters.

                    mask. His nose is heart-shaped, because J-Hope’s lips form a heart when he laughs. There are several
                    meanings to ‘mang’ in Korean. It can translate as ‘a pony’, ‘to fail’, and it’s the latter part of
                    the word ‘hope’ (huimang).

                <p class="lead">Chimmy, the playful puppy in yellow represents the band’s overall image, according to
                    Jimin. ‘The animal that goes best with BTS is a puppy,’ he said in the BT21 making of videos. ‘We
                    love to hang out, and we’re active, which reminds people of puppies.’ He also thinks Chimmy’s chubby
                    cheeks remind people of his face when BTS first debuted.

                    V once made a comment that purple represents love. RM drew pages and pages of koalas in the initial
                    sketching stage, as he thinks koalas are really cute.

                    that he transforms into a huge muscle man when he gets angry. Jungkook is known for his endless gym
                    workouts to maintain his six-pack, so in his initial sketches, he drew a rabbit with a six-pack. He
                    also wanted Cooky to always have a chocolate chip cookie, which inspired the next character, Shooky.

                    and hates milk. During the initial sketching period, Suga drew his dog, Holly, but it looked too
                    similar to other characters, so he drew lots of different expressions inspired by Holly instead.
